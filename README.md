Project Title: Student Registration System

Introduction: This full-stacked project is named Student registration system using MERN Stack - Mongodb, Express, React, Node.js).

The App is taking Students name. There is a dropdown arrow for lists of departments and the user should select the departments from the dropdown arrow. For each department, there is a corresponding course attached and hence after selecting the department, the user will select again the course to be taken. Once we click the Registered button, the name, department and course will be displayed in the browser and at the same time it will be recorded in MongoDB.

Client side ( front end).

There is a home page with some messages & footer. If a user clicks “Learn More”, it will expand, and detailed information will be found.

In Student List page, we can find the list of registered students for all departments. Under each name there is a DELETE & UPDATE button. If we want to delete the record, we can click the delete button and the record will be removed both from the database and the browser.

If there is a need to modify or update a record, we can update the record. Name is editable in this page and department and course will be selected from dropdown arrow.

When we click SAVE button after clicking update and do some modifications, the modified records will be displayed in the browser and saved in the database.

In case if we want to cancel what we have done, but before clicking SAVE button, we can cancel the transaction.

The website has Report pages. Hence, the user can generate different reports like (name lists of students registered for a given department, name lists of students registered for a given course, name lists of a department, name lists of courses to be given at each departments).

Thus, the APP is capable of handling CURD [ Create- the registration task, Update, Read (Student List display) and Delete.

Backend

This project has used three models namely (students, courses and instructors). Its schema has been defined in the models. It has also its respective controllers.

To be added features

• I have a plan to add more features in the log-in part. Now the login is not yet connected to the database and the server. It needs further enhancement to have authentication and different authority level.

• I will enhance to have more records about instructors.

• Records about Grade Report.

• More records of the student & instructors like Telephone, Age, email.
